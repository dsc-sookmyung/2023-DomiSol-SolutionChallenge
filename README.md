**🐥 Chick Check** is a project designed to detect inappropriate language and provides feedback to help improve language habits in daily life. 
The term 'Chick' literally refers to language that is discriminatory or sexist, and 'Check' means to check and correct it. 
Swearing can be detrimental to mental health and can even pose a threat to physical health, 
so it is important to be aware of the risks and strive to improve our use of language.

## ✨ Introduction

<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="스크린샷 2023-03-29 오후 9 14 05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97823928/228531979-0f3d9263-8775-4d84-acdd-75ff4cbc0061.png"></p>

**Chick Check** aims to detect swearing and provide feedback in order to ensure a healthy life and wellness, and further, to construct a prosperous society without gender discrimination. Swearing directly harms mental health, but sometimes indirectly threatens physical health. Poor mental health can affect emotions, thoughts, and other aspects, and if one's mental health deteriorates, it can lead to physical illnesses and health problems."

However, swearing occupies a considerable proportion in conversations of all ages. The prevalence of swearing is evidence that our society is mentally ill to that extent. Furthermore, swearing and hate speech are closely related to gender discrimination. Many swear words contain content that denigrates or hates women. Sexist swearing forms a negative perception of women and can demonstrate an inappropriate attitude towards women. That is also why our project is named 'Chick Check'.
